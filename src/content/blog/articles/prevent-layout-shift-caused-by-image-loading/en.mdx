When images are loaded after the initial render, they often cause layout shifts (unexpected movement of content), which negatively impacts the user experience. In this article, we’ll walk through a simple and effective approach to solving this problem using an image-containing popup example.

## Problem

In the video below, you can see that when the user clicks the **"Size guide"** button, a popup opens, but since the image takes time to load, the layout jumps unexpectedly.

  The loading of the popup has been intentionally delayed.

## Solve

To fix the problem, we take the following steps:

### 1. Track image loading state

We use a `useState` hook to track whether the image has finished loading:

```tsx
const [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = React.useState(false);

const handleLoadImage = () => {
  setImageLoaded(true);
};
````

This state will be updated once the image fires the `onLoad` event.

### 2. Conditionally show the popup based on load state

We use the `classNames` utility to conditionally apply a class when the image is loaded:

```tsx
<Popup
  show={showChartPopup}
  onClose={() => setShowChartPopup(false)}
  className={classNames("chart-popup", {
    "chart-popup-loaded": imageLoaded,
  })}
>
```

This allows us to control when the popup becomes visible based on whether the image has been fully loaded.

### 3. Use CSS to control visibility

In the CSS, we define `.chart-popup` to be hidden by default, and only show it when the image has loaded:

```scss
.chart-popup {
  display: none;
}

.chart-popup-loaded {
  display: block;
}
```

This prevents any content from being displayed or jumping until the image is ready.

### 4. Full Component Code

Here is the complete component:

```tsx
import React, { type FC } from "react";
import { Popup } from "ui-kit";
import classNames from "classnames";

export const SizeChartPopup = (sizeChartUrl: string) => {
  const [showChartPopup, setShowChartPopup] = React.useState(false);
  const [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = React.useState(false);

  const handleLoadImage = () => {
    setImageLoaded(true);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShowChartPopup(true)}>
        Size guide
      </button>

      <Popup
        show={showChartPopup}
        onClose={() => setShowChartPopup(false)}
        className={classNames("chart-popup", {
          "chart-popup-loaded": imageLoaded,
        })}
      >
        <img
          src={sizeChartUrl}
          alt="Product size chart"
          onLoad={handleLoadImage}
        />
      </Popup>
    </>
  );
};
```

## Result

Here’s the improved version, where the popup appears only after the image has loaded — smooth and stable:

## Conclusion

Image loading can easily lead to unexpected layout shifts, especially in modals or popups. In this post, we:

* Tracked when the image was loaded,
* Showed the popup only after the image was ready,
* Prevented visual instability using a simple CSS toggle.

Although it’s a small change in code, it has a significant impact on perceived performance and usability — particularly on mobile devices or slower networks.
