I have created to create mini-series about browser. We will focus on the **Web API**. Before we start the article, let's clarify what we mean by calling everything an API.

<Note type="info">
  **API (Application Programming Interface)** refers to structures that are used to access the features provided by the
  browser and contain methods/parameters. I like to simplify definitions.
</Note>

You have used many API so far; `console` object for logging, `window` object to access the browser page and `fetch` method to make HTTP requests etc. In this article, we will take a look at the **Console API** (of course it's not just `console.log`).

## Log methods

Let's start with the basics. The logs that we print in our application can have various meanings. For example, we can alert the user to use another function, report an error, or provide information about the result.

`log()` can be used to see the current status of the variable.

```js
const result = await axios.get(...);
console.log("Result:", result);
```

`info()` can be used to provide information to the end user on how to use a method correctly.

```js
console.info(
  'React Hook "useState" is called conditionally.'
);
```

`warn()` can be used to alert the user that a method's name has changed or it will be deprecated.

```js
console.warn(
  "Warning: componentWillMount has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https:/fb.me/react-unsafe-component-lifecycles for details."
);
```

`error()` can be used to report an error encountered in the code.

```js
console.error('SyntaxError: /src/App.js: Unexpected token, expected "(" (5:2)');
```

`debug()` can be used to view variables in real-time while developing. Unlike `console.log`, it does not appear in the console by default. To show it in Chrome, the **verbose** log level must be selected.

```js
console.debug("I couldn't find any example for this case...");
```

If we look at how they appear on console;

We don't use the others as much as `console.log`. But if we consider that we write a package, we want to make sure that the user understands any error or warning correctly.

## Assertion

We can use this method to print a log when spesific conditions are met. If the first parameter is false, the second parameter will print. Soooo, no need to use `if` statements anymore!

```js withOutput
> const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
> const statusCode = response.status;
>
> console.assert(statusCode === 200, "Occured an error!");

Occured an error!
```

## Clear logs

The method clears all console messages.

```js
console.clear();
```

<Note type="info">
  This method works in the browser but you may notice it doesn't work in the Node terminal. If you are looking for an
  alternative, you can use `process.stdout.write('\033c');` for clear stdout.
</Note>

## Countable log

Here is a gooood one. No need to create a variable anymore to count how many times a code block is executed. `count()` method takes care of that itself. We can use `countReset()` to reset the counter. And the label parameter can be used to customize counters.

```js withOutput
> for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
>   console.count();
>   console.count("myCounter");
> 
>   if (i === 2) {
>     console.countReset();
>   }
> 
>   if (i === 4) {
>     console.countReset("myCounter");
>   }
> }

default: 1
myCounter: 1
default: 2
myCounter: 2
default: 1
myCounter: 3
default: 2
myCounter: 4
default: 3
myCounter: 1
```

## Grouping logs

Sometimes output can be related and it can be difficult to exemine logs. We can group logs using `group()` and `groupCollapsed()`. To end the grouping, we can use `groupEnd()`.

```js
const name = "Enes";
const age = 21;
const city = "Bursa";
const country = "Turkey";

console.group("Person"); // or console.groupCollapsed()
console.log("Age: ", age);
console.log("City: ", city);
console.log("Country: ", country);
console.groupEnd();
```

We can also nest the groups.

```js
const name = "Enes";
const age = 21;
const city = "Bursa";
const country = "Turkey";

console.group("Person");
console.log("Age: ", age);
console.group("Location");
console.log("City: ", city);
console.log("Country: ", country);
console.groupEnd();
console.groupEnd();
```

## Log table

Objects and array can be hard to read in the console. They can visualize it in tabular form.

```js
console.table(["Turkey", "Italy", "England"]);
```

```js
const people = [
  { firstName: "Kemal", age: 21 },
  { firstName: "Can", age: 5 },
  { firstName: "Gürbüz", age: 76 },
];

console.table(people, ["firstName", "age"]);
```

```js
class Product {
  constructor(name, color, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.price = price;
  }
}

const product = new Product("Elbise", "Kırmızı", 299.9);

console.table(product);
```

```js
class Product {
  constructor(name, color, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.price = price;
  }
}

const dress = new Product("Elbise", "Kırmızı", 299.9);
const shoe = new Product("Ayakkabı", "Beyaz", 123);
const hat = new Product("Şapka", "Siyah", 520);

console.table([dress, shoe, hat], ["name", "color", "price"]);
```

## Time log

Sometimes we want to measure the execution time of a piece of code. We can take dates and get difference in the old way. However browser has a method for this. We use `time()` to start the timer, `timeLog()` to print current value and `timeEnd()` to stop it.

```js withOutput
> console.time("myTimer");
> 
> for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
>   console.timeLog("myTimer");
> }
> 
> console.timeEnd("myTimer");

myTimer: 0.003173828125 ms
myTimer: 0.06396484375 ms
myTimer: 0.08984375 ms
myTimer: 0.114013671875 ms
myTimer: 0.135009765625 ms
myTimer: 0.154052734375 ms
myTimer: 0.196044921875 ms
myTimer: 0.2119140625 ms
myTimer: 0.23193359375 ms
myTimer: 0.251953125 ms
myTimer: 0.27392578125 ms
```

## Trace

We use to see which functions were called and in what order until a function was called.

```js withOutput
> function mapData(result) {
>   console.trace();
> 
>   return {
>     name: result.name,
>     username: result.username,
>     email: result.email,
>   };
> }
> 
> async function getResult(response) {
>   const result = await response.json();
>   return mapData(result);
> }
> 
> async function fetchData(string) {
>   const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1");
>   return getResult(response);
> }
> 
> await fetchData();

console.trace
overrideMethod
mapData
getResult
await in getResult (async)
fetchData
await in fetchData (async)
(anonymous)
```
