If you don't like to manually increase the version from `package.json` when dealing with NPM packages, you can use the `npm version` command.

```bash withOutput
> npm version patch
> npm version minor
> npm version major
> npm version preminor
> npm version prerelease
> npm version 1.1.4

v0.0.1
v0.1.0
v1.0.0
v1.1.0-0
v1.1.0-1
v1.1.4
```

Sets a new commit containing the version change. You can use the `-m` flag to customize the message.

```bash withOutput
> npm version patch
> npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"
> git log --oneline -2

v0.0.1
v0.0.2

606095c (HEAD -> main, tag: v0.0.2) Upgrade to 0.0.2 for reasons
ac7c881 (tag: v0.0.1) 0.0.1
```
