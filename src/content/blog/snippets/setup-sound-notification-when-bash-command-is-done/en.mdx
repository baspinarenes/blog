When I run a command that takes a long time, I realize too late that it's completed while I'm doing other things. That's why I created an audible notify system using the script below.

```bash
npm install && say "npm install done"
```

If you want to add a tiny sound before the voice, you can use the `afplay` command.

```bash
npm install && afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff && say "npm install done"
```

You can convert this script into an alias.

```bash
notify() {                 
  local message=$1
  shift
  local command="$@"
  eval "$command" && afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff && say "$message"
}
```

You can now use it below:

```bash
notify "npm install done" "npm install"
```

## Notes

- You can list voices using the `say -v \?` command. For example, I can use `Yelda` voice for texts in Turkish.
  ```bash
  say -v Yelda "Selamlar"
  ```
