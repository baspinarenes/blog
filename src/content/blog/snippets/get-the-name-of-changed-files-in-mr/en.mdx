In companies with unestablished pipeline systems, there is always a risk of incidents with config changes. The short term solution is to analyze the changed files to prevent them from being sent along with the code.

You can use `git diff` to get a list of changed files in a practical way.

```bash
git diff --name-only ${SHA}
```

## Notes

- You can use Gitlab's predefined `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DIFF_BASE_SHA` variable to find changed files in MR pipelines.
- If you are only interested in the names of the files, you can switch to the `--name-only` flag.
