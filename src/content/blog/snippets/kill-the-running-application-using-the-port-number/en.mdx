When I close my applications running in the terminal, sometimes ports don't die and `killall node` doesn't work. 

You can use `kill` to force close the port.

```bash
 sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:{PORT})
```

You can then assign aliases to simplify usage.

```bash
alias killport="killport_function"
killport_function ()
{
  sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:$1)
}
```

Put the above code in your `~/.zshrc` file and run `source ~/.zshrc`. You can now use it as follows. 

```bash
killport 3000
```
