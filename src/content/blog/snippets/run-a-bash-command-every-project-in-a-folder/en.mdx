When the number of projects I had to manage increased, it became difficult to keep them synchronized. Especially when I wanted to search across all projects, I had to run `git pull` for each project individually. Then I created a snippet.

You can use `find -exec` to run your commands on all projects in a folder.

```bash
find . \
  -mindepth 1 \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type d \
  -exec sh -c '(echo “\n${}” && cd {} && git pull)' \
\;
```

## Notes

- Walks all folders at the depth you specify with `mindepth` and `maxdepth`.
